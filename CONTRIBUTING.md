# How to contribute

Check out the current issues, see if there's anything you can/want to fix.

Please send a [pull request](https://github.com/Sueztech/Coursewatch/pull/new/master) to Coursewatch with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests [here](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our code style (please, no tabs! use 4 spaces instead) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). Always write a clear log message for your commits.

Thanks,<br>
Kevin Abraham
